**PPE Detection Using Object Detection**

This project uses a machine learning model to detect Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in images using object detection techniques. Utilizing a pre-annotated dataset with various PPE items like helmets, gloves, masks, and safety vests, the YOLOv8 model was trained to identify and locate these items within images. The model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix for classification accuracy. It was also tested on various video footage to demonstrate real-time PPE detection in dynamic environments.

This model can be applied to workplace safety monitoring, ensuring compliance with safety protocols by providing real-time alerts for missing PPE. It also streamlines safety audits and compliance checks by quickly identifying whether workers are equipped with the necessary protective gear. This project showcases the potential of advanced object detection to enhance workplace safety and efficiency.
